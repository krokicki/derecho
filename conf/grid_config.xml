<!-- 

This configuration file defines all the nodes on the grid, and how they are to be displayed.

Each node set (<nodes>) must define a row and column position in one of two ways:
1) A 'row' and/or 'col' attribute
2) A regex group. If there are two groups, the first is the row, the second is the group.

A node may match multiple node sets, but only the last matching definition in the first matching subset will be used.
